# CanSat
My Teensy code for CanSat using Arduino IDE and my PCB schematics and design using AutoDesk Eagle for the same.
This code fulfils the problem statement of CanSat 2019 organized by American Astronautical Society (AAS).
This code has not been tested with actual hardware yet so certain errors may be expected.
There are certain libraries for the board/schematic(AutoDesk EAGLE) which I couldn't find online so I made those libraries and uploaded in the repo.
